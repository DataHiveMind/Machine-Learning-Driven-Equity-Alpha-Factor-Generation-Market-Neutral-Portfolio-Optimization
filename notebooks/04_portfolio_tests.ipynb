    "# Purpose: \n",
    "This is where you translate model predictions into a tradable, marketâ€‘neutral portfolio and test its resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What it covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Converting model scores into expected returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Applying portfolio optimization with constraints (beta neutrality, sector caps, turnover limits).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Running a historical backtest with transaction costs and slippage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Performing Monte Carlo simulations (bootstrap or Gaussian) to generate distributions of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Summarizing performance: Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, hit rate, and variability across simulated paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Visualizing equity curves, drawdown charts, and MC distribution plots."
